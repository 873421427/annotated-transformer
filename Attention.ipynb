    "# Abstract \n",
    "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being  more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing  both with large and limited training data."

Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer.  While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.                                                                                             \n",

    "While for small values of $d_k$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_k$ \\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17}. We suspect that for large values of $d_k$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients  \\footnote{To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$.  Then their dot product, $q \\cdot k = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_ik_i$, has mean $0$ and variance $d_k$.}. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$.

    "* In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder.   This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.  This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as \\citep{wu2016google, bahdanau2014neural,JonasFaceNet2017}.                                                        \n",
    "* The encoder contains self-attention layers.  In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder.   Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.                                                                \n",
    "* Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position.  We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property.  We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to $-\\infty$) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections.
