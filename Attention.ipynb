While ideally math should communicate what exactly is going on, many of the \"details\" turn out to be quite important to getting good results.\n",

    "> The following is an exercise in practicing what I preach. The recent [\"Attention is All You Need\"/Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper from NIPS 2017 has been an instantly impactful paper in machine translation and likely NLP generally. The paper reads in a very clean way, but the conventional wisdom has been that it is very difficult to implement correctly. \n",

    "> This blog post presents an annotated guide to the paper. My goal is to implement every detail from the paper (and its references) inline with the paper itself. To do so, I will interleave the text from the paper, with a line-by-line PyTorch re-implementation. (I have done a bit of reordering of the original paper, and skip some of the non-implementation sections for brevity).\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being  more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU.  On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing  both with large and limited training data."

Given $\\mathbf{z}$, the decoder then generates an output sequence $(y_1,...,y_m)$ of symbols one element at a time.

    "While for small values of $d_k$ the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of $d_k$ \\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/BritzGLL17}. We suspect that for large values of $d_k$, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients  \\footnote{To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of $q$ and $k$ are independent random variables with mean $0$ and variance $1$.  Then their dot product, $q \\cdot k = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_ik_i$, has mean $0$ and variance $d_k$.}. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_k}}$.          "

    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension $d_{\\text{model}}$.  We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.  In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to \\citep{press2016using}.   In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by $\\sqrt{d_{\\text{model}}}$. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks.  For the base model, we use a rate of $P_{drop}=0.1$.                                                                                                                                 "
